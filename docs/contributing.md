# Contributing

> :exclamation: Before you will run a pull request and make changes to the code, just create an [issue](https://github.com/m1ner79/twitterGitHubActions/issues) and let's chat what would you wish to change.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies.
3. Create your branch from master.
4. Make your changes in the code.
5. Run tests: `npm test`, and fix any code issues with `npm run lint-fix`.
6. Now you are ready to issue that pull request.

## Requirements

If you are, like myself :wave:, a total GitHub begginer. Terms like `pull, fork, clone` scare you :scream:. Have no fear :muscle:, because all the help is just a :point_right: [click](https://help.github.com/en) away. It is the link to GitHub Help page where you can find everything you need to help you out :tada:.
